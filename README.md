## Hello! I'm Jair Carbajal 👋🏽

## About Me:

I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer 👨🏽‍💻 <br/>
I studied Psychology in college, but made a career change to software because love building things and solving problems.
<br/>
My father, grandfather, and great grandfather were all roofers for the majority of their life. Roofing is hard on the body, so I chose to learn how to code instead. 🏠
<br/>
I love music of all kinds, but need to pick up my guitar and practice more 🎶 
<br/>
I have two dogs and two cats! 🐕‍🦺🐕‍🦺 🐈🐈
